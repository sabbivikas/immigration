            What the map shows
          </h2>
          <p>
            The particle map combines data from multiple US government
            sources. Each dot represents roughly 300 people. The data is
            layered by how people arrived: legal admissions through ports
            of entry, border encounters recorded by CBP, visa overstays
            estimated by DHS, and &ldquo;gotaways&rdquo; (known but
            unapprehended crossings) from CBP operational data and
            congressional testimony.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are distinct populations. Border encounter data (CBP)
            measures crossings. Settlement data (Census ACS) measures
            where foreign-born people live. Admission category data
            (USCIS) measures how people were legally classified. Each
            tells a different part of the story.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink tracking-tight pt-4">
            Settlement destinations
          </h2>
          <p>
            Where dots land on the map is based on Census ACS
            foreign-born population data, weighted by region-of-origin
            affinities. For example, Mexican-origin dots are more likely
            to settle in Texas, California, and Illinois because that
            matches the actual settlement patterns in ACS data. The
            scatter radius is randomized within metro areas for
            readability.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-ink tracking-tight pt-4">
            Gotaway estimates
          </h2>
          <p>
            The &ldquo;uncounted&rdquo; layer uses known gotaway
            figures from CBP operational data shared in congressional
            briefings and testimony. CBP does not officially publish
            these numbers; they originate from internal dashboards
            reported by news outlets and confirmed in hearings
            (notably Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz&rsquo;s Senate
            Judiciary Committee testimony in May 2023). Monthly values
            are weighted by seasonal border crossing patterns.

            <li>
              Encounter counts include repeat crossings; the same

            <li>
              ACS foreign-born estimates lag by approximately two years
              and include all foreign-born residents regardless of
              immigration status.

              USCIS admission categories cover lawful permanent residents
              only, not temporary workers or undocumented individuals.

              Gotaway figures are approximate. By definition they exclude
              people who crossed without being detected at all.
